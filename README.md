<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Breakout Arcade game, created using the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a paddle to bounce the ball and break blocks. The goal is to destroy all the blocks without allowing the ball to fall below the paddle.
<br />

<h2>Features</h2>

 - <b>Graphical Interface</b>: Built with the Turtle graphics library for a visual, arcade-style experience.
 - <b>Mouse-Controlled Paddle</b>: Paddle follows the player's mouse movements.
 - <b>Randomized Block Colors</b>: The blocks have randomly generated colors, making each game visually unique.
 - <b>Ball-Paddle Interaction</b>: The ball bounces off the paddle and walls, with speed changes based on collisions.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

 - <b>Initialize the Game</b>: The game window is set up using Turtle's screen, with fixed dimensions.
 - <b>Mouse-Following Paddle</b>: The paddle moves horizontally, following the mouse cursor within boundaries.
 - <b>Block Creation</b>: 50 blocks are generated in random colors and placed in rows at the top of the screen.
 - <b>Ball Movement</b>: The ball moves in a constant direction and bounces off walls, the paddle, and blocks.
 - <b>Block Collision</b>: When the ball hits a block, the block disappears, and the ball's direction changes.
 - <b>Win/Lose Condition</b>: The game ends either when all blocks are destroyed (win) or the ball falls below the paddle (lose).
